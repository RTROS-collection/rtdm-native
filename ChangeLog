	* ksrc/drivers/can/*: The option CONFIG_XENO_DRIVERS_CAN_BUS_ERR now
	enables bus error interrupts when an application is calling a receive
	function on a socket listening on bus errors. After one bus error has
	occured, the interrupt will be disabled to allow the application time
	for error processing and to efficiently avoid bus error interrupt
	flooding. This option is automatically selected for CAN controllers
	supporting bus error interrupts like the SJA1000.

	* include/rtdm/rtcan.h: Add some doc on bus-off and bus-error error
	conditions and the restart policy.

	* examples/rtdm-native/canconfig.c: Controller mode settings and doc
	has been corrected.

	* ksrc/drivers/can/rtcan_raw.c (rtcan_raw_setsockopt): Fix

	* Started: inital port of RTDM-native, the RTDM over native Linux with
	the real-time preemption and high-resolution timer patch. The RTDM
	drivers tree has been extracted from the Xenomai trunk on 2007-03-18.
